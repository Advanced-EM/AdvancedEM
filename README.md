# Advanced EM Analyis

This a repository containing the material for Advanced Analysis in Transmission Electron Microscopy and related techniques course. The lectures and scripts were designed to cover the 

The scripts used over the course are written in Python and I strongly recommend creating a conda environment and install the dependencies as we move forward in the course.

----------


The basic configuration needed is:

Anaconda (or Python 3.6)

### Why Python?

Python is well established in the scientific community. It is usable both for developers, but also for many microscopists.

Python has good interoperability with low-level languages like C, and can be use as a interfacial language for existing low-level routines.

There is a large number of packages for scientific computation (many of them targeted to image and spectrum analysis) leveraging existing native libraries.
