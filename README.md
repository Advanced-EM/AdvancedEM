# Advanced EM Analysis
----------------------

This a repository containing the material for Advanced Analysis in Transmission Electron Microscopy and related techniques course. The lectures and scripts were designed to cover advanced topics in TEM image and spectrum analysis to help you leverage your expertise and boost up the quaity of your research.  

The scripts used over the course are written in Python and I strongly recommend the usage of Anaconda python distribution. 
First, download and install Anaconda. Instructions can be found at www.anaconda.com/download.

---------------------
### 1. Create a conda environment:

To facilitate handling of the dependencies, further updates, etc.. I recommend creating a conda environment.

Detailed instructions on how to creat a conda environment can be found [here](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/)

For more information about conda offical documentation can be found [here](https://conda.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Extra Content and Resources:

### Why Python?

Python is well established in the scientific community. It is usable both for developers, but also for many microscopists.

Python has good interoperability with low-level languages like C, and can be use as a interfacial language for existing low-level routines.

There is a large number of packages for scientific computation (many of them targeted to image and spectrum analysis) leveraging existing native libraries.
